# PasswordGeneratorMac
Simple macOS tool to generate random password string and copy it to clipboard.

## Usage
* Download the latest binary: [PasswordGenerator](https://github.com/indywidualny/PasswordGeneratorMac/releases/latest)
* Make it executable `chmod +x PasswordGenerator`
* Move it to /Applications to avoid loosing it (and to let it be indexed by Spotlight)
* Simply run the program somehow - new password string is in your clipboard now

## Info
Tested on Sierra. I created this program to quickly generate random password like strings which I later save on my Keychain or in my browser. We don't really need to remember our passwords anymore nowadays.
